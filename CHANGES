changes:

  0.3:
    - Spyc parsing engine is rewritten from scratch (one-pass parsing). It runs now _much_ faster.
    - A bug with colons in comments is fixed (thanks to Neil Galvin)
    - Fixed: a bug when the source ends with a literal block, the scripts loops for ever, with an error message (index out of bound). Thanks to Pascal  Diethelm.
    - Some more bugs in the engine are fixed.
    - Only alphanumeric characters are now allowed in reference names.
    - Fixed a bug with inline arrays (thanks Tobiah for pointing it out).
    - Fixed a bug with ">" symbol (thanks to Pierre Tardy).
    - Numerous bugs also fixed (thanks to fellow programmers and bug reporters)
    
  0.2.5:
    - All .yml file extensions changed to .yaml (see recommendation: http://yaml.org/faq.html)
    - Compartibility fix for PHP < 4.2.0 (no need to compile PHP with --enable-ctype)
    - PHP5 version is not failing self-tests now (one of the fixes for 0.2.4 was buggy)

  0.2.4:
    - Sped up overall performance by a hundred times or so by using different node id generation algorithm.
    - Implemented Tobias Gruetzmacher's changes:
      - Explicit boolean dumping.
    - Fixed a bug causing "arr1: [a, ['1', "2"], b]" to not parse correctly. Some important changes in _inlineEscape().
    - Fixed a bug for PHP5 version (YAMLDump and YAMLLoad should be declared static).
    - Fixed a bug with malformed YAML resulting in E_NOTICE level errors.
    - Fixed a bug in YAMLDump that caused structures like "array ('key': 'colon: colon')" to be dumped in non-literal style.
    - Sped up overall performance by 10% or so by using different child selection algorithm in _gatherChildren
    - Another change for speed: optimized the behaviour of _array_kmerge

  0.2.3:
    - Fixed a bug causing "- {name: "Foo, Bar's", age: 20}" to not parse
      correctly.  Related to _inlineEscape() changes in 0.2.2, I believe.

  0.2.2:
    - Implemented Mustafa Kumas' changes:
      - Improved regex in _inlineEscape() method.
    - Improved handling of escaped single and double quotes within strings.

  0.2.1:
    - Implemented Fabien Potencier's changes:
      - Fixed warnings reported by E_STRICT
      - More complete YAML boolean support (on/off yes/no y/n)
    - Produce error when someone tries to use tabs instead of spaces.
    - Moved array_kmerge function into a private method.
    - Added PHP5 strict version of class (spyc.php5).
    - Added line break preservation in dump()
    - Added some string checking sanity before calling file_exists()

  0.2:
    - Hashes (#) can now be used in strings, and comments work better.
    - Fixed warning about non-object.
    - Numeric keys are now allowed.
    - '"key" : value' is now allowed (space after quoted key name)
    - Underscore (_) and other crazy characters now allowed in key names of
      dumped arrays.
    - Added options/parameters to change indent and wordwrap length in dump()
    - Added a really primitive, lo-fi output test script.

  0.1.1:
    - Fixed notices that were being generated when set to E_ALL.
    - Defined some private properties like a good OOPer.
